# Simple Responsive Landing Page

This project demonstrates a clean and responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS. The page features a header with navigation, a hero section with a call-to-action, and a footer with social links, all designed to be fully responsive across various devices.

## Building Process

### 1. Project Setup and HTML Structure

First, the project directory `landing-page` was created. Inside this directory, `index.html` was set up with a basic HTML5 structure. Semantic HTML elements were used for the header, main content (hero section), and footer to ensure good accessibility and structure. A link to `style.css` was added in the `<head>` section.

**Key HTML Elements:**
- `<header>`: Contains the logo and navigation menu.
- `<main class="hero">`: The main hero section with a prominent heading, description, and call-to-action buttons.
- `<footer>`: Includes multiple sections for brand information, quick links, and social media icons.

### 2. CSS Styling and Responsive Layout

The `style.css` file was created to provide comprehensive styling for the landing page. Modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid were utilized for efficient and flexible layout management. Responsive design was a core focus, implemented using media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, especially for tablet and mobile devices.

**Key CSS Features:**
- **Global Resets:** Basic CSS resets for consistent rendering across browsers.
- **Header Styling:** Fixed header with a subtle blur effect and smooth transitions for navigation links.
- **Hero Section Styling:** A vibrant linear gradient background with a subtle grain overlay, and animations for content appearance.
- **Button Styling:** Stylish call-to-action buttons with hover effects and subtle animations.
- **Footer Styling:** A multi-column footer layout that adapts to smaller screens.
- **Responsive Navigation:** A hamburger menu for mobile views that toggles the navigation list with smooth transitions.
- **Animations:** `fadeInUp` animation for hero content and subtle hover effects for interactive elements.

### 3. Responsiveness Testing

The landing page was thoroughly tested in the browser to ensure full responsiveness and functionality across different screen sizes. This involved:
- Checking the overall layout and styling on desktop.
- Scrolling to verify all sections, including the footer, are displayed correctly.
- Simulating mobile viewports using browser developer tools to test the responsive design, particularly the hamburger menu functionality and layout adjustments.
- Verifying anchor link functionality for navigation buttons.
